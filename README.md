# ﻿﻿Software Development Plan

### Statement of Purpose and scope for Terminal Application

##### What will the application do?
The Note taking app will allow users to easily make files/directories, take notes easily that will automatically be saved to a quicknote.txt file, and read the contents of that file.
#####Why am I developing it?
I am developing this app because I personally wanted to be able to quickly and easily make notes from the command line, as I'm usually pretty bad at organising and keeping my notes all in one place. So I thought it would be interesting to make an application that did that for me.
#####Why/How it would be used?
As to the why it would be used, I would imagine it would make it easy for developers that work in the command line a lot to take quick simple notes that they could find easily later. It can be used fairly easily from the CLI.

###Features

1. Make Directories(folders)/files.
2. Make simple notes.
3. Print those notes to the terminal for ease of access.

###User Experience
#####How will the user find out how to interact with/use each feature
The application has easy to read prompts that ask the user to input a command, along with options that they can choose from.
#####How the user will interact with/use each feature
The user can simply type in the command for what they want the application to do, e.g. If the user inputs 'quicknote' into the terminal after running the program a prompt of 'quicknote: ' will appear under which another line appears saying "type 'back' at any point to end task".

#####How errors will be handled by the application and be displayed to the user?
If they type in a command that is not realised by the program, a prompt saying "I'm sorry I didn't quite catch that".
